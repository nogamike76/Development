Developing new computers
This Project is solely based off of the current situation the world is in. My Goal is to create a computer(super Computer) to create a new system, server, network, etc., to control the resources we have
which should have been a freely open resource that can be obtain for free. This will also reduce the workload by pretty much everyone will be unemployed.
Sounds like it won't work but it will, just have faith and everything will work out.
Any Questions, you can email me at nogamike76@gmail.com
